<h2>Introduction</h2>
Devon Decks & Dice, is a full stack website for an imagined board games cafe. It encourages sign up by offering extra features if someone is logged in, such as leaving comments on events (with full CRUD functionality), registering interest in said events, booking tables at the cafe and even creating a personalised user profile to show off favourite board games.

Wireframes and database relational diagrams were created before any coding was started in order to give a good overall picture of what I was aiming for and to prevent any headaches trying to change the database models later on in the project.

Wireframes were created with Balsamiq. The original plans were:

Entity relationship diagrams were created with Lucidchart:
